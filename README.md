# Magnus Expansion of the Pairing Model

## Summary
An implementation of the Magnus expansion to solve the pairing model for eight single 
particle states and four particles.  Both a Python and a C++ implementation of the Magnus 
Expansion will be shown.  The results from the calculations will also be presented below.
The derivative method for solving the IMSRG problem will be used as a comparison.
